# Description
Little module that adjusts the heigth of some inline elements to look the same

# How to use
1. Include the script in your html file
 ><script type="text/javascript" src="js/equalHeights.js"></script>
1. Edit the last line of the module to pass the 3 parameters
  * Class of the container of the elements to adjust
  * Class of the child elements to fix
  * Breakpoint - Number of minimum pixels to run the code.
    On smaller screens elements are probably displayed vertically
    and you don't want the script to run.
